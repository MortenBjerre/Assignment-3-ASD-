The assisngment is a simplified version of checkers. 
You are only permitted to move diagonally forward by one row unless you are able to jump the opponents piece.
It is only possible in this version to jump on piece per turn. Multiple jumping is not implemented. 



** The game should be run with the CheckersFull.java fill and not checkers. 
I had a bit of trouble managing my files so i kept it as a backup in case something was lost.**
