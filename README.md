The assisngment is a simplified version of checkers. 
You are only permitted to move diagonally forward by one row unless you are able to jump the opponents piece.
It is only possible in this version to jump on piece per turn. Multiple jumping is not implemented. 

In the src folder in Mdt3 there is a 'game' package containing the game and 'testing' package containing the unit test. 
I made a unit test of the game class using JUnit. I have not tested the Player class since it relies on the Game class. The Board class is mostly updating an array, which i do not think make much sense to test. 

** The game should be run with the CheckersFull.java file and not checkers.java file. 
I had a bit of trouble managing my files so i kept it as a backup in case something was lost.**
